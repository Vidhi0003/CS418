    "_According to the **Academic Integrity Policy** of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regard to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, and you cannot submit someone elseâ€™s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying and pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml._\n",

Instructions on how to submit it to Gradescope are given at the end of the notebook and should be followed carefully.\n",

    "For the IMDb example below (**Q2.1**), since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Spotify) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) for more information.\n",

    "    * Track and Artist Data: detailed information about tracks and artists.\n",
    "    * Genre and Popularity Trends: Analyze trends in music genres and track popularity over time.\n",
    "    * Audio Features: Analyze tracks based on audio features like tempo, key, and more.\n",
    "    * Personal Relevance: the Spotify API enables you to find data that resonates with your personal interests and preferences, making the analysis more engaging and insightful.\n",

    "\n",
    "To access the Spotify API, you will need to perform a few steps. Like many other platforms, Spotify uses authentication and rate limiting to control access to its data. This ensures fair usage and compliance with Spotify's policies. The first step (even before making any request) is to set up a Spotify Developer account and obtain API credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Spotify](https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login) account (if you do not have one already)\n",
    "2. Log into the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) using your Spotify account. \n",
    "2. Generate API keys (if you haven't already). Create an app and select \"Web API\" for the question asking which APIs are you planning to use. Once you have created your app, you will have access to the app credentials. These will be required for API authorization to obtain an access token.\n",

For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information.
